{"name":"HodgkinHuxley","tagline":"A simulator of Hodgkin & Huxley's neuron model.","body":"HodgkinHuxley 1.0.8\r\n=============\r\nA simulator of Hodgkin &amp; Huxley's neuron model.\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n-------------\r\nhe functioning of neurons is a complex biological process, which is very accurately described by the HodgkinHuxley model. Unfortunately, it consists of a 4-dimensional, non-linear system of differential equations without an explicit, analytical solution. This simulator, however, numerically solves it for you and allows you to interact with variables such as the conductivity of the membrane on the go! Designed for Neuroscience students, this simulator will help you to understand the dynamics of both the model and the actual neuron very deeply.\r\n\r\n![HodgkinHuxley](http://www.robinrump.com/hh.jpg)\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n-------------\r\n- Dynamically inject a current and watch the reaction of the membrane potential.\r\n- Dynamically change the conductivities of the membrane.\r\n- Watch the change of the gating variables n, m, h.\r\n- Export data to JSON and XML.\r\n- Export graphs to PNG, JPG and PDF.\r\n- Written in C++ and Qt.\r\n- Multi-Platform: Runs on Windows, Mac and Linux.\r\n- Open Source.\r\n\r\nCopyright\r\n-------------\r\nThe HodgkinHuxley Simulator was written by [Robin Rump](http://robinrump.com/) and is licensed under the GPL v3.\r\nIt uses the QCustomPlot library by [Emanuel Eichhammer](http://qcustomplot.com/).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
